# Data Types Practice

This assignment will give you the opportunity to practice working with
the fundamentals of JavaScript covered in the prework.

## Prerequisites

* Fundamental JavaScript
* Numbers, Strings, and Booleans
* Variables
* Arrays
* Array Methods

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

## Requirements

There are a series of prompts inside of the starter code found in the Script.js file. Each
prompt is in the form of a JavaScript comment. Write your code to solve the
prompt *after* the comment.

You can Use javascript by running `node` on the terminal to run the script as seen below:

```

node script.js

```

> make sure to clone from your own fork! Not from SEIR-0508, as is done in the example above.

Some prompts will require you to practice researching methods we did not learn
in class.

> **Tip:** Use `console.log` to test your work, but delete those statements when you
> finish working on the prompt, before moving on to the next one! Otherwise,
> you'll end up with a lot of clutter in your console and it will be hard to
> debug the prompt you're currently working on.

**You are required to make one commit after each prompt**
